<p>I am currently a Cloud Architect at <a href="https://onica.com/">Onica</a>.</p>

<p>Before Onica, I was the Cloud Advisory Consultant at <a href="https://www.accenture.com/">Accenture</a> where helped client's define their journey to the Cloud. Before that designed, built and operated globally distributed systems at 
  <a href="https://www.ey.com/">EY</a>

<p>I've been designing, developing, and building distributed systems since 2008 in both hands-on and leadership roles. I am a pragmatic, transparent, 
  results driven technologist who wants to help get work done. I thrive in team-oriented cultures where we're all 
  working hard for a common goal.</p>

<p>I live with my family in Sydney, Australia.</p>
