<p>I am currently work as a Cloud Architect at <a href="https://onica.com/">Onica</a>, a Rackspace company, where I'm helping to build out their <a href="https://www.rackspace.com/en-gb/solutions/elastic-engineering">Elastic Engineering</a> capability in APJ.</p>

<p>Before Onica I was a Cloud Advisory Consultant at <a href="https://www.accenture.com/">Accenture</a> in London. There I helped enable clients on their journey to the Cloud. Before that I designed, built and ran globally distributed systems at 
  <a href="https://www.ey.com/">EY</a>

<p>I've been designing, developing, and building distributed systems since 2008 in both hands-on and also  leadership roles. I am a forward thinker who looks outwards for new ideas, transparent, and a results-driven technology leader. I understand the importance of organisational culture, teams, and growing relationships.
</p>

<p>I live with my family in Sydney, Australia. I enjoy traveling and surfing.</p>
