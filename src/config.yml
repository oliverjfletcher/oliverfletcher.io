        Title: G'day, I'm Oli üåä
        Content: "I currently work as a Engineering Manager at [Rackspace Technology](https://www.rackspace.com/en-gb), where I'm helping to build out the [Elastic Engineering](https://www.rackspace.com/en-gb/solutions/elastic-engineering) capability across APJ. During my time with Rackspace I have worn many hats, from pre-sales, strategy, leadership, architecture, and engineering. \n
          \n
          Before Rackspace, I was a Cloud Advisory Consultant at [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/) in London. There I helped enable clients on their journey to the Cloud. Prior to that I designed, built and ran globally distributed systems at [EY](https://www.ey.com/). \n
          \n
          I've been designing, developing, and building distributed systems since 2008 in both hands-on, strategic and leadership roles. \n
          \n
          I am a forward thinker who looks outwards for new ideas, transparent, and a results-driven technology leader. I understand the importance of organisational culture, teams, and growing relationships. \n
          \n
          I live with my family in Sydney, Australia. I enjoy surfing üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è music üé∂ reading üìö and travel üöÄ"
